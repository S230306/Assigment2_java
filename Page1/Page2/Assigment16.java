/* world cup 2
It is the World Cup Finals. Sonu only finds a match interesting if the skill difference of the competing teams is less than or equal to D.

Given that the skills of the teams competing in the final are X and Y respectively, determine whether Sonu will find the game interesting or not.

Note : use function.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of T testcases follows. Each testcase consists of a single line of input containing three space-separated integers X, Y, and D â€” the skill levels of the teams and the maximum skill difference.

Constraints

1<=T<=2000 1<=X,Y<=100 0<=D<=100

Output Format

For each testcase, output "YES" if Chef will find the game interesting, else output "NO" (without the quotes). The checker is case-insensitive, so "YES" and "NO" etc. are also acceptable.
